# PWC - Bibitor, LLC: Inventory Analysis Case Study

### Case Background
Bibitor, LLC* is a liquor store chain in the fictional state of Lincoln. It is a major retailer with approximately
80 locations and total sales in excess of $450 million.
Bibitor has asked the team to complete due diligence on their wine and spirits business looking at data for their 
beginning and ending inventory, purchases and sales for a 12 month period.

### Data Source
I have used Bibitor, LLC data to analyze and identify inventory trends from year 2016 which can be downloaded from [PWC Data analytics case study data files](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/careers/university-relations/data-and-analytics-case-studies-files.html)

### Data Exploration
I explored the data to get familiar and decide what can be useful for due diligence.

### Case Studies
#### Case Study 1:
Executive leadership is looking for dashboard reporting that would be useful to help identify and monitor vendor activity in order to focus efforts strategically on key supplier relationships.
1. Ive created an aggregate table that includes all critical vendor billings and their associated purchasing activity
   SQL Query: [Data Case 1.1](

2. Ive created separate tables to store key information, such as ‘top 10 vendors’ by quantity purchased.

#### Case Study 2:
You notice that there is inventory that is purchased but sits on the shelf for a long period of time rather than being sold.  
As such, there is an opportunity to add value to the procurement process by identifying trends in the timing inventory purchased versus its corresponding sale.  
I considered key data points around purchase prices, seasonality, and vendor information in creating an aggregate table for future visual & statistical analysis.
